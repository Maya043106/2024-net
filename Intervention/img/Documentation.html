    The intervention that I did for this week's exercise is putting an empty water bottle that was on Harry Styles on Etsy and selling it for $24.99. 
    I choose the site Etsy because its usually a website where clothes, jewelry and other trinkets are sold. So putting something as strange as an empty water bottle that's Harry Styles is something that disturbs the website and what people are selling. 
    This intervention took place on March 6th and I was shocked by what happened but also not surprised. 
    When looking back at my intervention I saw that 2 people viewed my page about the water bottler but no one bought anything which made sense to me since it was something off putting that I put on the website. 
    If I had more time to expand on my intervention I might add more pictures and maybe a video of the water bottle. 
    I would also probably not use a Poland Spring water bottle and do something to make it more customizable to sell to people.
