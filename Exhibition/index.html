    <h1>Net Art Exhibition: Digital Nostalgia: Exploring where Technology intersects with Memory</h1>
  <p>This exhibitions main theme is Nostalgia which uses digital net art as a way of viewing the past. 
    While not only drawing from creative aesthetics and obscured symbols of the 21st century 
    but from video games and other technology based works they all stem from moments in life 
    that were not only short lived but recalled meaningful memories for many. These net art works all
    make individuals feel a sentimental longing for something that happened in the past. 
    Through different digital art, artists will also evoke feelings of exploration in the
    way technology shapes and influences memories and how those memories allow people to reflect on their own personal experiences.

    The first exhibition created by James White A carefully chosen collection of White's digital works, each bearing witness to the timeless appeal of the past and the limitless potential of the future, are available for audiences to peruse.
    The second exhibition created by sibling artists Jessica, Jacob Ciocci, and Ben Jones, collectively known as Paper Rad, presents visitors with a colorful trip through the digital environments from the 1980s and 1990s, where each pixel is alive with the spirit of the past.
    The last exhibition created by Olia Lialina, experience's relationships, self-discovery, and the passing of time as you travel through the moving digital stories of Olia Lialina, where memories blend with technology.
